#  All About Me â€“ Website

Hi, Welcome to my personal website project, proudly created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**.

Explore it here: https://ekjotkaursault.github.io/all_about_me/

I have also used several 'Emojis' to increase readability and to make website more attractive and beautiful ðŸ˜Š.


## Project Highlights

###  Fonts Used

* **Poppins** â€“ for body content, headings, and overall clean readability
* **Dancing Script** â€“ for highlighting names and headers in a decorative cursive style

###  Color and Style Choices

* **Backgrounds:**

  * Light yellow gradients: `linear-gradient(90deg, #ffca28, #ffd54f)` for nav & header
  * Pale peach gradients: `linear-gradient(135deg, #fdfcfb, #e2d1c3)` for culture.html
  * Overall soft tones to give a peaceful, welcoming feel.

* **Typography Effects:**

  * Italics used for welcome messages: `<i>Welcome to my personal webpage!</i>`
  * Bold tags (`<strong>`) highlight key details such as location, studies, and cultural words.

### Layout and Structure

* Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid:

  * `.about-content` uses flex layout for photo + bio.
  * `.hobby-grid` uses CSS Grid for cards layout.
  * `.gallery` uses flex wrap and spacing.

* Section-based design with reuse of `.card` class for consistent look.

* Hover effects on images and cards for subtle animation.

* Clean navigation bar fixed to top with hover animations.

### Images and Media

* Personal images: I have taken some of the images from my 'google photos' and some are downloaded from 'google'

  * `Ekjot_kaur.jpg`: my profile picture (rounded and shadowed)
  * `Golden_Temple.png`, `Baisakhi.png`, etc.: showcase my roots
  * `Pizza.png`: shows personal favorite food spots in Canada
* Embedded Google Maps iframe to highlight my hometown: **Moga, Punjab**



## Folder & File Structure  --- This is how, i planned my website.

## **Features Implemented in Code**

### HTML Pages

Each page (`index.html`, `hobbies.html`, `culture.html`) includes:

* Shared navigation bar with links to all 3 pages
* Hero banner with large heading and welcome line
* Decorative `<span class="highlight">` for emphasized words
* `<section class="card">` for content areas with consistent design

### CSS Styling Highlights

* `body` uses soft gradient background for calm appearance
* `.top-nav` is sticky, fully responsive, and styled with a dual yellow gradient
* `.hero h1` uses Dancing Script at `3.5rem`, stylized for personality
* Cards (`.card`) use semi-transparent white, with blur & shadow for a glassy effect
* `.profile-pic` is fully rounded with hover scale and shadow
* `.gallery img` uses hover zoom + border radius
* `.hobby-card` uses grid layout with icon headings and styled text
* Footer is styled to match header with gradient, shadow, and centered text

##  How It Was Built -- The procedure, that i followed.

1. **Setup GitHub Repository**

   * Created `all_about_me` repo
   * Uploaded all `.html`, `.css`, and image files manually via GitHub

2. **Designed Each Page**

   * `index.html` as the homepage (About + Location)
   * `hobbies.html` for interest cards
   * `culture.html` for traditions + image gallery

3. **Style and Polish**

   * Used Google Fonts for visual appeal
   * Applied CSS transitions and shadows for interactivity
   * Ensured mobile-friendliness with responsive layout

4. **Deploy via GitHub Pages**

   * Opened `Settings > Pages`
   * Set build from: `main branch â†’ /(root)`
   * GitHub generated live URL

* Linking external fonts using Google Fonts
* HTML semantics: `section`, `figure`, `figcaption`, `iframe`
