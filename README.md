Hi! Welcome to my **personal website project**, proudly created using **HTML** and **CSS**, and hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

### 🎨 Fonts Used
- **Poppins** – for body content, headings, and overall clean readability.  
- **Dancing Script** – for highlighting names and headers in a decorative cursive style.

### 💛 Color and Style Choices
**Backgrounds**
- Light yellow gradient: `linear-gradient(90deg, #ffca28, #ffd54f)` for navigation and header.  
- Pale peach gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #fdfcfb, #e2d1c3)` for culture.html.  
- Soft pastel tones are used throughout the site to give a peaceful, calm, and welcoming appearance.

**Typography Effects**
- *Italicized text* (e.g., *Welcome to my personal webpage!*) is used for friendly greetings.  
- **Bold text** (`<strong>`) highlights key points such as my college, location, or cultural details.

## 🧩 Layout and Structure

### Responsive Design
The website is fully responsive and designed using **CSS Flexbox** and **Grid Layout**:
- `.about-content` → flex layout (for image and biography side-by-side)
- `.hobby-grid` → CSS grid layout for hobbies section
- `.gallery` → flexible wrap with even spacing for images

Each content area uses a reusable `.card` class for consistency and alignment.

### Interactivity
- Subtle hover animations on cards and images for smooth transitions.
- Fixed top navigation bar with hover color changes and highlight effect.
- Footer designed with matching gradient, shadow, and centered text.

## 🖼️ Images and Media

I used a mix of my **personal photos** and **web resources** to illustrate my story:

- `Ekjot_kaur.jpg` → my personal profile photo (rounded & shadowed).  
- `Golden_Temple.png`, `Baisakhi.png` → cultural and traditional visuals.  
- `Pizza.png` → represents one of my favorite Canadian food spots 🍕.  
- Embedded **Google Maps iframe** to show my hometown: *Moga, Punjab* 🗺️.
